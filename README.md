# whosbl33h
My personal portfolio implemented with React. The eslint, vite and tailwind technologies were also used.

# Files
- src: the file that implements de solution.
-  assets: resources that are used in an application.
- components: reusable pieces of code that define the appearance and behavior of a part of the UI.
- pages: the different areas of the portfolio.
- constants: values that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution.
